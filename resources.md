# Creating my own debugger yeyy :D

Which lib should i use to create the debugger GUI?
How to debug a process in Linux?
Breakpoints are not that hard i guess

## Resources

[Writing a Windows debugger in Rust from Ex Microsoft Debugger Platform developer](timdbg.com/posts/writing-a-debugger-from-scratch-part-1/)

## Todo

- [ ] Create a GUI would be a good start.
- [ ] Start requested process?
- [ ] Learn how debuggers are made because my understand of this topic is poor.
- [ ] Display opcode, address, and instructions.
- [ ] Breakpoints i guess.
- [ ] What more, dont really know.
